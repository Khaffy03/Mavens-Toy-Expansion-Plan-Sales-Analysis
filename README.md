2. August recorded the least revenue generated.
3. Product Category Toy are the best performing category both in reveneue and profit.

### Recommendations

- Based on the Analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Investigate reasons for dips in February and March, replicate strategies that drove growth in April and May, and implement targets campaigns to sustain moments in the coming months
- Focus on strengthening sales for high-performing products (Clocks and Vases), improve strategies for low performers (Rugs and Wall Frames), and maintain consistency for mid-tier - products (Cookware, Ornaments, Phones).
- Enhance e-commerce platforms and digital marketing to further boost online sales.
- Develop tailored strategies to boost sales in Township and CDP.
- Target North Carolina with localized strategies to boost sales.
- Recognize top performers like Nicholas Cunningham, Donald Reynolds, and Joe Price. Support lower-performing teams (e.g., Patrick Graham) with additional resources, training, or motivation to help improve sales.

### Limitations

- I had to remove  two decimal points of the revenue,cost,average transaction columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. i had to expand the canvas area to have the  dashboard on a sheet since that is what the task denote.
